Welcome to the Connect 4 README. The classic old-style game programmed by : Alícia Chimeno Sarabia in C. (Using Xcode in MAC M1 2020).

The goal of the game is to place 4 pieces in a row, before your opponent!  Place pieces into the board by pressing number keys between zero and seven [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. The bard is 8x8. (the size could be changed if desired).
Your pieces are represented by an “X” while the computer player's pieces are “O”s. The best player out of 3 games wins.
